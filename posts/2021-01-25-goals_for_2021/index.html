  <h1>A few goals for the year 2021</h1>

<li>
<p>Don&#8217;t get COVID-19.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve made it this far, and the vaccine is so close that this goal is a
no-brainer&#8212;&#8203;even though as a middle-aged, nonessential, stay-at-home
person I&#8217;ll be last in line for the vaccine.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kill the grass in my front yard.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don&#8217;t see the point in having front-yard grass in Arizona. But I
dislike rock yards, too, so it&#8217;s unclear what final form the yard will
take when the grass is gone. Something involving dirt. As for the
process of killing the grass, I&#8217;m going to try solarization so as to
use herbicide minimally.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read at least twenty books.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Seems like this goal should be easily doable if I swap out the time I
normally spend reading idiotic opinions on the Internet and instead read
books written by informed people. Another no-brainer.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fitness goals?</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Prior to breaking my hip in the last week of the year 2020, I had a goal
for 2021 to break one hour on the LMI Trail 100 course, along with a few
other running and biking goals, but now those goals are scrapped. I may
try to match my accomplishment last year of biking and running a total
of 10,000 miles, but doing so will certainly entail more biking and less
running.</p>
