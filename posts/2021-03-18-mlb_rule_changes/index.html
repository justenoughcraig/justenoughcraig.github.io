  <h1>MLB rule changes</h1>
  <em>Thursday, March 18, 2021</em>
  <div class="paragraph">
<p>The recent <em>USA Today</em> article by Gabe Lacques about MLB rule changes
(print-only, no link?) inspired me to write this post, in large part
because I disagree with most of what Mr. Lacques wrote. Sadly, I foresee
MLB continuing to make changes I don&#8217;t like and failing to make changes
I would like—all in part of the bigger trend of pro sports becoming more
serious and less weird and fun.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>7-inning doubleheaders.</strong> Thumbs down. Something about 7-inning games
makes me think <em>little league</em>, as in, it&#8217;s not something grown men
should be doing. Generally, I don&#8217;t like rule proposals that decrease
how much happens in a game, as there&#8217;s a better way to speed up the
game. (Hint: pitch clock.) Lastly, there&#8217;s the matter of math: a
doubleheader of 7-inning games isn&#8217;t a doubleheader, it&#8217;s a
one-and-five-ninths-header.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>10th inning runner on second base.</strong> Thumbs down. The 10th inning is
too early to panic about how long a game is taking. I think this rule
could make sense for some cases, such as starting with the 13th inning
of a getaway game, but we should be careful about this. One of the
beautiful aspects of baseball is that a game goes on for as long as it
must by <em>following normal rules</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Three-batter minimum.</strong> Thumbs up. If I were in charge, I would one-up
this rule and require pitchers to finish the inning. The only
exception would be to exit mid-inning and go straight to the injured
list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Expanded playoffs.</strong> Thumbs up. Notwithstanding my nostalgia for the
old days of a tiny playoff field, playoff baseball is too much fun not
to expand. Indeed, I would one-up the expanded postseason by adding
two mid-season tournaments, one in June and the other in August. All
thirty teams would enter both tournaments, and good results in either
would win points that would contribute towards wildcard berths for the
postseason playoffs. A mediocre regular season team should make the
postseason playoffs if they&#8217;re clutch enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Universal DH.</strong> Thumbs down. Some people say the game is better when
the best players are on the field, which is supposed to be interpreted
as pitchers not hitting, but in actuality it means we should allow
nine designated hitters, which is, of course, stupid. It also means
high school and college games are less fun, which is also stupid. But
stupid premises lead to stupid conclusions. If I want to watch a team
full of hyper-specialized people doing their one thing, I&#8217;ll attend
more work meetings. No thanks. Suffice to say, my favorite all-time
MLB moment I&#8217;ve seen in person was <a href="https://youtu.be/cUGesL4Efbc">relief
pitcher Archie Bradley&#8217;s two-out triple</a> in the 2017 NL wildcard
game—in large part because of how improbable it was.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other ideas:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Add a pitch clock.</strong> Baseball is dithering about speeding up the game
when all that&#8217;s needed is a pitch clock that prevents slow pitchers
from being themselves. I boycott certain starting pitchers for
in-person games because of those pitchers' propensity to dawdle. The
pitcher dictates the rhythm of the game, and a fast tempo makes for a
fun game to watch, regardless of outcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bring back the four-pitch intentional walk.</strong> The abracadabra
(no-pitch) walk, added in 2017, was sold as speeding up the game,
which is unlikely considering that MLB was averaging
<a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/bat.shtml">only 0.2
intentional walks per game at the time</a>. As far as solving the stated
problem, this is a non-solution. Whereas, requiring pitchers to throw
the ball allows for <a href="https://youtu.be/IJBMm70kRgo">crazy things to
happen</a>—all part of the essence of baseball. Besides, intentional
walks typically happen during the dramatic parts of a game, which
aren&#8217;t the parts that should be sped up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bring back the original pennant.</strong> Long before MLB or the modern era,
there was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Base_Ball_Players">one
pennant</a>, which stayed with a team until that team lost a series to
another team. An intrepid soul on the Internet has
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/jzmwct/the_original_pennant_post_2020_update/">tracked
this pennant into modern times</a>. What&#8217;s the point? It&#8217;s a fun and
weird sideshow. Formalize it. Make the pennant a tangible asset—i.e.,
flag, trophy, whatever—that travels with the winning team. But, more
importantly, assign cash bonuses to the team and players for winning
it and holding it. Or maybe have the league fund ticket discounts for
fans while their team holds the pennant. The point is to find ways to
make the regular season more varied and fun—especially for
non-contending teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Two-game and four-game playoff series.</strong> It&#8217;s a mathematical fact that
a playoff series can be an even number of games. The way it works is
the higher seed wins the series by winning only half the games,
whereas the lower seed wins the series by winning half-plus-one games.
For example, in a two-game series, the higher seed needs only one win,
whereas the lower seeds needs to win both games. This lopsidedness is
a feature, not a bug, when this format is used in wildcard situations
and first rounds in expanded playoffs where the higher seed should
have a big advantage. The idea is to give potential Cinderella teams
their chance while giving the highly seeded teams their due.</p>
