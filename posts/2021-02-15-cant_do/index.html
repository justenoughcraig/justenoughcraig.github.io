  <h1>Can&#39;t-do the pandemic</h1>
  <em>Monday, February 15, 2021</em>
  <div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to complain about with the year 2020, but I&#8217;m limiting
myself to this short rant: the United States became a “can&#8217;t do”
country.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Defined the narrative as either protecting health or protecting the
economy. Why not try both?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suffered falling economic output but had no plan other than to
stimulus-spend the problem away. Why not put people to work building
infrastructure and durable capital goods and other good stuff?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complained about businesses, schools, and churches closing. Why not
open them outdoors? If Scandinavians can hold outdoor school through
the winter, so can we.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defended our pandemic response as being no worse—or not much
worse—than other countries'. Why not do better?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For all my eye rolling at American exceptionalism, that philosophy at
least entails a can-do spirit of trying new things and succeeding where
others fail. Whereas, this new American ethos lacks imagination and
courage and is just plain sad to see.</p>
