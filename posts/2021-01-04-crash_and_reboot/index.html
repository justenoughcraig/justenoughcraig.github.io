  <h1>Crash and reboot</h1>
  <em>Monday, January 4, 2021</em>
  <div class="paragraph">
<p>Ten days ago, the day after Christmas, I crashed my bicycle at Tempe
Beach Park going around a slick curve. It was an uncomplicated crash—the
kind I typically get up from with no more harm than some scrapes and
bruises and maybe some shredded Lycra. But I didn&#8217;t get up from this
crash. Not right away, not without tremendous difficulty, and not
without realizing I wasn&#8217;t going to get to the grass five feet away
without crawling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That day couldn&#8217;t have ended soon enough. Shivering in the cold grass
waiting for help, the painful trip to the ER, and the two-hour wait in
the waiting room. Surgery the next day. That five-foot crawl to the
grass turned out to be the easiest move I made over those next
twenty-four hours.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m now at home nursing a broken femur—technically a hip fracture. I&#8217;ve
got new titanium hardware in my leg, and I&#8217;m using a front-wheeled
walker to get around: cue the old-man jokes. But mostly I&#8217;m lying in bed
with a lot of free time. It&#8217;s great time to reboot <em>Just Enough Craig</em>.</p>
