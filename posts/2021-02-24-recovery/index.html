  <h1>Recovery</h1>
  <em>Wednesday, February 24, 2021</em>
  <div class="paragraph">
<p>After breaking my hip a little more than two months ago, I&#8217;m still
limited to walking and biking as my only two activities—along with
physical therapy stuff, which doesn&#8217;t count because it&#8217;s not fun.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Back in January, as soon as I felt good enough to get on the bike, I
did, for a twenty-minute ride. Mounting and dismounting were the hard
parts; pedaling felt fine. Also, let&#8217;s assume I have a trainer and used
it, because biking on the roads with a two-week-old broken femur would
have been really stupid. Laura would have been justified in giving me
grief had I done so, but of course she didn&#8217;t because I didn&#8217;t and not
because she&#8217;s awesomely supportive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I started that first day on the bike at twenty minutes and added about
five minutes each day. I missed only two days, on an account of rain,
which is weird considering I was safely indoors on the trainer. Anyway,
after two weeks I had built up to about an hour-and-a-half, and within
two more weeks I had started a goal of riding at least two hours each
day. That streak is now at twenty days. In miles, 890. Total moving
time, 55 hours. I don&#8217;t remember having ever biked this much over a
three week period—not even when I biked to and from work every day while
doing group rides and biking my errands.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve also never biked this slow. No group rides. Almost no
high-intensity work. Slowing to a crawl when going up hills. It&#8217;s weird
feeling fatigue from easy efforts alone. I&#8217;m trying to gauge my fitness,
but it&#8217;s hard to measure without the hard efforts. Is all this riding
making me fitter? How would I know? I&#8217;m left looking at indirect
markers, such as resting rate going down and wattage at such-and-such
heart rate going up. But there&#8217;s so much noise in these things from
day-to-day that it&#8217;s hard to tell.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In two days the streak will be at risk due to scheduling. Probably I
would benefit from the rest, but I&#8217;m enjoying the experiment so much I
would like to keep it going.</p>
