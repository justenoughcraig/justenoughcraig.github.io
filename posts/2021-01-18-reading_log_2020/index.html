  <h1>Reading Log, 2020</h1>
  <em>Monday, January 18, 2021</em>
  <div class="paragraph">
<p>Last year&#8217;s reading list is short. My favorite novel is a toss-up
between <em>2312</em> and <em>The Years of Rice and Salt</em>, both by Kim Stanley
Robinson, who is my new favorite current author. He blends a creative
and optimistic outlook on things while simultaneously being realistic
about environmental and political problems going on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My favorite non-fiction book is <em>The Boys in the Boat</em>, which is a
breezy but fun account of the eight-oar crew team from the University of
Washington that won the gold at the 1936 Olympics. I&#8217;ll give an
honorable mention to <em>Factfulness</em>, which is a good reminder to pay
attention to specifics and to facts rather than relying on narratives—a
good lesson especially for the year 2020.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>My favorite short story is <a href="https://poestories.com/read/goldbug">The Gold
Bug</a>, by Edgar Allan Poe.</p>
