  <h1>High-volume biking goal</h1>
  <em>Monday, May 10, 2021</em>
  <div class="paragraph">
<p>My bicycling goal for this year is to bike 730 hours, i.e., an average
of two hours per days. I&#8217;m currently behind on this goal by eighteen
hours. This isn&#8217;t bad considering I began the year with a broken hip and
missed the first week entirely, then spent another three weeks building
up to riding two hours in a single day. Then, in late March I missed
most of two weeks while suffering a GI bug. But otherwise I&#8217;ve had good
health, and when I&#8217;ve been well enough to ride, I&#8217;ve ridden <em>a lot</em>.
Now, more than four months into the year, I&#8217;ve got some perspective on
the ups and downs of having a high-volume biking goal.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The goal complements many of the fun things about riding a bike: being
out on the roads in the quiet hours before dawn, exploring around town
because there&#8217;s no rush to be anywhere but on my bike, and finding
any excuse to make a trip by bike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&#8217;m enjoying my newfound pattern of waking up super early sans alarm
clock. I no longer consider an on-the-bike start time of 5AM as early.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fitness benefits of doing high volume are evident, but they&#8217;re not
as striking as I expected. Volume alone does not make me fast. And my
goal requires care so as not to interfere with recovering and putting
in the high-intensity “quality” riding needed to capture full fitness
benefits. I&#8217;m still figuring this one out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that the pandemic is ending—or has it ended?—social obligations
are returning and the halcyon days of introversion and isolation are
over. This means occasional late nights up, trips out of town, and
other goings on that interfere with being on the bike for two hours in
the morning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gonna need to figure out the summer monsoon months. In years past I&#8217;ve
decreased mileage for a couple of months starting late July, but this
year I have no such luxury—especially being as how I have eighteen
hours to make up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Overall, this goal has been a positive force in my life and has pushed
me to ride a lot more than I would have otherwise. But the sheer
quantity of averaging two hours <em>every day</em> is taxing—physically,
mentally, socially—and I&#8217;m already thinking about how to revise this
number down for next year.</p>
