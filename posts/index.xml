      <title>Can&#39;t-do the pandemic</title>

      <description>There&amp;#8217;s a lot to complain about with the year 2020, but I&amp;#8217;m limiting myself to this short rant: the United States became a “can&amp;#8217;t do” country.
   Defined the narrative as either protecting health or protecting the economy. Why not try both?
  Suffered falling economic output but had no plan other than to stimulus-spend the problem away. Why not put people to work building infrastructure and durable capital goods and other good stuff?</description>

      <title>Why GitHub?</title>

      <description>GitHub is free for me to use.
  It&amp;#8217;s sufficient for hosting a static site.
  It was fast to get started on.
   At the technical level, this blog—like most blogs—is nothing more than a way for the reader to look at one document at a time while having some links to navigate between documents. This use case is well solved by the early incarnation of the Web back in the 1990s—that bygone era when the browser&amp;#8217;s “back” button worked correctly on all sites.</description>

      <title>Getting heart rate right</title>

      <description>Nearly all advice I&amp;#8217;ve read about using heart rate for exercise is wrong. In this post I&amp;#8217;ll share some of my opinions, which may also be wrong, but that I think are less wrong.
  Heart rate monitoring makes sense only in the context of subtracting out resting heart rate. For example, if you have a resting heart rate of 50bpm and a maximum heart rate of 170bpm, then you have an maximum heart rate range of 120bpm (170bpm - 50bpm).</description>

      <description>Don&amp;#8217;t get COVID-19.
I&amp;#8217;ve made it this far, and the vaccine is so close that this goal is a no-brainer&amp;#8212;&amp;#8203;even though as a middle-aged, nonessential, stay-at-home person I&amp;#8217;ll be last in line for the vaccine.
   Kill the grass in my front yard.
I don&amp;#8217;t see the point in having front-yard grass in Arizona. But I dislike rock yards, too, so it&amp;#8217;s unclear what final form the yard will take when the grass is gone.</description>

      <description>Last year&amp;#8217;s reading list is short. My favorite novel is a toss-up between 2312 and The Years of Rice and Salt, both by Kim Stanley Robinson, who is my new favorite current author. He blends a creative and optimistic outlook on things while simultaneously being realistic about environmental and political problems going on.
 My favorite non-fiction book is The Boys in the Boat, which is a breezy but fun account of the eight-oar crew team from the University of Washington that won the gold at the 1936 Olympics.</description>

      <description>In April of last year, still in the early days of the pandemic, I quit using soap in the shower. Because of the social distancing going on at the time, there would be no better opportunity to try the experiment. But now, with the hindsight of knowing how trouble-free the experience was, I wish I had quit soap much sooner. I wish I never started using soap in the first place.</description>

      <description>Ten days ago, the day after Christmas, I crashed my bicycle at Tempe Beach Park going around a slick curve. It was an uncomplicated crash—the kind I typically get up from with no more harm than some scrapes and bruises and maybe some shredded Lycra. But I didn&amp;#8217;t get up from this crash. Not right away, not without tremendous difficulty, and not without realizing I wasn&amp;#8217;t going to get to the grass five feet away without crawling.</description>
