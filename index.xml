      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten days ago, the day after Christmas, I crashed my bicycle at Tempe
Beach Park going around a slick curve. It was an uncomplicated crash—the
kind I typically get up from with no more harm than some scrapes and
bruises and maybe some shredded Lycra. But I didn&amp;#8217;t get up from this
crash. Not right away, not without tremendous difficulty, and not
without realizing I wasn&amp;#8217;t going to get to the grass five feet away
without crawling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That day couldn&amp;#8217;t have ended soon enough. Shivering in the cold grass
waiting for help, the painful trip to the ER, and the two-hour wait in
the waiting room. Surgery the next day. That five-foot crawl to the
grass turned out to be the easiest move I made over those next
twenty-four hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m now at home nursing a broken femur—technically a hip fracture. I&amp;#8217;ve
got new titanium hardware in my leg, and I&amp;#8217;m using a front-wheeled
walker to get around: cue the old-man jokes. But mostly I&amp;#8217;m lying in bed
with a lot of free time. It&amp;#8217;s great time to reboot &lt;em&gt;Just Enough Craig&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
