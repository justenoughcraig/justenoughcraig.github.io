      <description>Last year&amp;#8217;s reading list is short. My favorite novel is a toss-up between 2312 and The Years of Rice and Salt, both by Kim Stanley Robinson, who is my new favorite current author. He blends a creative and optimistic outlook on things while simultaneously being realistic about environmental and political problems going on.
 My favorite non-fiction book is The Boys in the Boat, which is a breezy but fun account of the eight-oar crew team from the University of Washington that won the gold at the 1936 Olympics.</description>
