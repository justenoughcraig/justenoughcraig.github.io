      <description>Nearly all advice I&amp;#8217;ve read about using heart rate for exercise is wrong. In this post I&amp;#8217;ll share some of my opinions, which may also be wrong, but that I think are less wrong.
  Heart rate monitoring makes sense only in the context of subtracting out resting heart rate. For example, if you have a resting heart rate of 50bpm and a maximum heart rate of 170bpm, then you have an maximum heart rate range of 120bpm (170bpm - 50bpm).</description>
