1. Don't get COVID-19.
+
I've made it this far, and the vaccine is so close that this goal is a
no-brainer--even though as a middle-aged, nonessential, stay-at-home
person I'll be last in line for the vaccine.

2. Kill the grass in my front yard.
+
I don't see the point in having front-yard grass in Arizona. But I
dislike rock yards, too, so it's unclear what final form the yard will
take when the grass is gone. Something involving dirt. As for the
process of killing the grass, I'm going to try solarization so as to
use herbicide minimally.

3. Read at least twenty books.
+
Seems like this goal should be easily doable if I swap out the time I
normally spend reading idiotic opinions on the Internet and instead read
books written by informed people. Another no-brainer.

4. Fitness goals? 
+
Prior to breaking my hip in the last week of the year 2020, I had a goal
for 2021 to break one hour on the LMI Trail 100 course, along with a few
other running and biking goals, but now those goals are scrapped. I may
try to match my accomplishment last year of biking and running a total
of 10,000 miles, but doing so will certainly entail more biking and less
running.
