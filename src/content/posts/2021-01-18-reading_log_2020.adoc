Last year's reading list is short. My favorite novel is a toss-up
between _2312_ and _The Years of Rice and Salt_, both by Kim Stanley
Robinson, who is my new favorite current author. He blends a creative
and optimistic outlook on things while simultaneously being realistic
about environmental and political problems going on.

My favorite non-fiction book is _The Boys in the Boat_, which is a
breezy but fun account of the eight-oar crew team from the University of
Washington that won the gold at the 1936 Olympics. I'll give an
honorable mention to _Factfulness_, which is a good reminder to pay
attention to specifics and to facts rather than relying on narratives—a
good lesson especially for the year 2020.

My favorite short story is https://poestories.com/read/goldbug[The Gold
