title: "High-volume biking goal"

My bicycling goal for this year is to bike 730 hours, i.e., an average
of two hours per days. I'm currently behind on this goal by eighteen
hours. This isn't bad considering I began the year with a broken hip and
missed the first week entirely, then spent another three weeks building
up to riding two hours in a single day. Then, in late March I missed
most of two weeks while suffering a GI bug. But otherwise I've had good
health, and when I've been well enough to ride, I've ridden _a lot_.
Now, more than four months into the year, I've got some perspective on
the ups and downs of having a high-volume biking goal.

* The goal complements many of the fun things about riding a bike: being
  out on the roads in the quiet hours before dawn, exploring around town
  because there's no rush to be anywhere but on my bike, and finding
  any excuse to make a trip by bike.

* I'm enjoying my newfound pattern of waking up super early sans alarm
  clock. I no longer consider an on-the-bike start time of 5AM as early.

* The fitness benefits of doing high volume are evident, but they're not
  as striking as I expected. Volume alone does not make me fast. And my
  goal requires care so as not to interfere with recovering and putting
  in the high-intensity “quality” riding needed to capture full fitness
  benefits. I'm still figuring this one out.

* Now that the pandemic is ending—or has it ended?—social obligations
  are returning and the halcyon days of introversion and isolation are
  over. This means occasional late nights up, trips out of town, and
  other goings on that interfere with being on the bike for two hours in
  the morning.

* Gonna need to figure out the summer monsoon months. In years past I've
  decreased mileage for a couple of months starting late July, but this
  year I have no such luxury—especially being as how I have eighteen
  hours to make up.

Overall, this goal has been a positive force in my life and has pushed
me to ride a lot more than I would have otherwise. But the sheer
quantity of averaging two hours _every day_ is taxing—physically,
mentally, socially—and I'm already thinking about how to revise this
number down for next year.
