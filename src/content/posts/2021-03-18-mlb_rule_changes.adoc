title: "MLB rule changes"

The recent _USA Today_ article by Gabe Lacques about MLB rule changes
(print-only, no link?) inspired me to write this post, in large part
because I disagree with most of what Mr. Lacques wrote. Sadly, I foresee
MLB continuing to make changes I don't like and failing to make changes
I would like—all in part of the bigger trend of pro sports becoming more
serious and less weird and fun.

* *7-inning doubleheaders.* Thumbs down. Something about 7-inning games
  makes me think _little league_, as in, it's not something grown men
  should be doing. Generally, I don't like rule proposals that decrease
  how much happens in a game, as there's a better way to speed up the
  game. (Hint: pitch clock.) Lastly, there's the matter of math: a
  doubleheader of 7-inning games isn't a doubleheader, it's a
  one-and-five-ninths-header.

* *10th inning runner on second base.* Thumbs down. The 10th inning is
  too early to panic about how long a game is taking. I think this rule
  could make sense for some cases, such as starting with the 13th inning
  of a getaway game, but we should be careful about this. One of the
  beautiful aspects of baseball is that a game goes on for as long as it
  must by _following normal rules_.

* *Three-batter minimum.* Thumbs up. If I were in charge, I would one-up
  this rule and require pitchers to finish the inning. The only
  exception would be to exit mid-inning and go straight to the injured
  list.

* *Expanded playoffs.* Thumbs up. Notwithstanding my nostalgia for the
  old days of a tiny playoff field, playoff baseball is too much fun not
  to expand. Indeed, I would one-up the expanded postseason by adding
  two mid-season tournaments, one in June and the other in August. All
  thirty teams would enter both tournaments, and good results in either
  would win points that would contribute towards wildcard berths for the
  postseason playoffs. A mediocre regular season team should make the
  postseason playoffs if they're clutch enough.


* *Universal DH.* Thumbs down. Some people say the game is better when
  the best players are on the field, which is supposed to be interpreted
  as pitchers not hitting, but in actuality it means we should allow
  nine designated hitters, which is, of course, stupid. It also means
  high school and college games are less fun, which is also stupid. But
  stupid premises lead to stupid conclusions. If I want to watch a team
  full of hyper-specialized people doing their one thing, I'll attend
  more work meetings. No thanks. Suffice to say, my favorite all-time
  MLB moment I've seen in person was https://youtu.be/cUGesL4Efbc[relief
  pitcher Archie Bradley's two-out triple] in the 2017 NL wildcard
  game—in large part because of how improbable it was.

Other ideas:

* *Add a pitch clock.* Baseball is dithering about speeding up the game
  when all that's needed is a pitch clock that prevents slow pitchers
  from being themselves. I boycott certain starting pitchers for
  in-person games because of those pitchers' propensity to dawdle. The
  pitcher dictates the rhythm of the game, and a fast tempo makes for a
  fun game to watch, regardless of outcome.

* *Bring back the four-pitch intentional walk.* The abracadabra
  (no-pitch) walk, added in 2017, was sold as speeding up the game,
  which is unlikely considering that MLB was averaging
  https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/bat.shtml[only 0.2
  intentional walks per game at the time]. As far as solving the stated
  problem, this is a non-solution. Whereas, requiring pitchers to throw
  the ball allows for https://youtu.be/IJBMm70kRgo[crazy things to
  happen]—all part of the essence of baseball. Besides, intentional
  walks typically happen during the dramatic parts of a game, which
  aren't the parts that should be sped up.

* *Bring back the original pennant.* Long before MLB or the modern era,
  there was
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Base_Ball_Players[one
  pennant], which stayed with a team until that team lost a series to
  another team. An intrepid soul on the Internet has
  https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/jzmwct/the_original_pennant_post_2020_update/[tracked
  this pennant into modern times]. What's the point? It's a fun and
  weird sideshow. Formalize it. Make the pennant a tangible asset—i.e.,
  flag, trophy, whatever—that travels with the winning team. But, more
  importantly, assign cash bonuses to the team and players for winning
  it and holding it. Or maybe have the league fund ticket discounts for
  fans while their team holds the pennant. The point is to find ways to
  make the regular season more varied and fun—especially for
  non-contending teams.

* *Two-game and four-game playoff series.* It's a mathematical fact that
  a playoff series can be an even number of games. The way it works is
  the higher seed wins the series by winning only half the games,
  whereas the lower seed wins the series by winning half-plus-one games.
  For example, in a two-game series, the higher seed needs only one win,
  whereas the lower seeds needs to win both games. This lopsidedness is
  a feature, not a bug, when this format is used in wildcard situations
  and first rounds in expanded playoffs where the higher seed should
  have a big advantage. The idea is to give potential Cinderella teams
  their chance while giving the highly seeded teams their due.
