There's a lot to complain about with the year 2020, but I'm limiting
myself to this short rant: the United States became a “can't do”
country.

* Defined the narrative as either protecting health or protecting the
  economy. Why not try both?

* Suffered falling economic output but had no plan other than to
  stimulus-spend the problem away. Why not put people to work building
  infrastructure and durable capital goods and other good stuff?

* Complained about businesses, schools, and churches closing. Why not
  open them outdoors? If Scandinavians can hold outdoor school through
  the winter, so can we.

* Defended our pandemic response as being no worse—or not much
  worse—than other countries'. Why not do better?

For all my eye rolling at American exceptionalism, that philosophy at
least entails a can-do spirit of trying new things and succeeding where
others fail. Whereas, this new American ethos lacks imagination and
courage and is just plain sad to see.
