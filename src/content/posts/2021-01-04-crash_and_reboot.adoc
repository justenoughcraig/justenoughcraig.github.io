Ten days ago, the day after Christmas, I crashed my bicycle at Tempe
Beach Park going around a slick curve. It was an uncomplicated crash—the
kind I typically get up from with no more harm than some scrapes and
bruises and maybe some shredded Lycra. But I didn't get up from this
crash. Not right away, not without tremendous difficulty, and not
without realizing I wasn't going to get to the grass five feet away
without crawling.

That day couldn't have ended soon enough. Shivering in the cold grass
waiting for help, the painful trip to the ER, and the two-hour wait in
the waiting room. Surgery the next day. That five-foot crawl to the
grass turned out to be the easiest move I made over those next
twenty-four hours.

I'm now at home nursing a broken femur—technically a hip fracture. I've
got new titanium hardware in my leg, and I'm using a front-wheeled
walker to get around: cue the old-man jokes. But mostly I'm lying in bed
with a lot of free time. It's great time to reboot _Just Enough Craig_.
