* GitHub is _free_ for me to use.

* It's _sufficient_ for hosting a static site.

* It was _fast_ to get started on.

At the technical level, this blog—like most blogs—is nothing more than a
way for the reader to look at one document at a time while having some
links to navigate between documents. This use case is well solved by the
early incarnation of the Web back in the 1990s—that bygone era when the
browser's “back” button worked correctly on all sites. Why should I
over-complicate things by pulling in bad ideas from the 2000s?

Here are some advantages of _not_ using newfangled web ideas:

* Loads fast and uses few resources.
 
* Renders correctly on all devices, e.g., phones.

* Plays nice with accessibility features, such as screen readers and
  high-contrast color schemes for the visually impaired.

* Plays nice with user customizations, such as special fonts or
  light-on-dark “nighttime” color schemes.

* Could easily be moved to another site. The only thing lacking at the
  moment to make such a move seamless is a domain name, i.e., money.

The one nice feature missing by having a static blog is that there
aren't any user comments. But are user comments actually nice? They're
prone to spam, which requires my intervention, and their core feature of
_communication_ is easily accomplished via email. I can then relay
interesting user comments to all users in future posts. Indeed, this
post is an answer to such a user comment.
